# Kahoot! challenge - auto-completion

## Description

To solve this challenge I decided to implement Trie (prefix tree) data structure with several key functions. The following functionalities are provided:

- **Search Prefix**: A function to check whether a given prefix exists in the Trie.
- **Autocomplete**: A function to return a list of words with a specified prefix.
- **Insert**: A function to insert new words into the Trie.

To make the solution more user-friendly, I created a simple user interface in Kotlin. The application allows users to search for words with a given prefix and add new words to the Trie.

## Technologies
- **Kotlin**: The primary programming language used to implement the application.
- **Jetpack Compose**: Used to build the user interface.
- **Trie Data Structure**: Implemented to manage the word data.

## How to Use
1. **Search for a Word**: Enter a prefix in the search field to find words in the Trie with that prefix.
2. **Add a New Word**: Use the "Add" functionality to insert a new word into the Trie.
3. **Navigate**: The user interface allows you to navigate between different functions for searching and adding words.
